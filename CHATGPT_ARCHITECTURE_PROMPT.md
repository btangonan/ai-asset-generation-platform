## 🔍 Current System Analysis

### ✅ Strengths (Build Upon These)
1. **Solid Backend Infrastructure**: Complete reference upload system with GCS, thumbnails, multipart support
2. **Production Ready**: Live deployment with authentication, rate limiting, monitoring
3. **Flexible Architecture**: Supports both Google Sheets and web app interfaces  
4. **Reference Image Support**: Up to 6 reference images with style_only/style_and_composition modes
5. **Real AI Generation**: Working Gemini 2.5 Flash integration with actual image output
6. **Cost Controls**: Built-in cost estimation and batch limits

### 🔧 Current Limitations (Need Evolution)
1. **Web App UX Gap**: React app still uses blob URLs instead of implemented cloud storage system
2. **Basic Batch Management**: Linear workflow without sophisticated progress tracking
3. **Limited Reference Pack UX**: No organization, naming, or reuse of reference image sets
4. **Synchronous Processing**: Direct API calls limit scalability for larger batches
5. **Basic Error Recovery**: Simple retry without partial failure handling
6. **No Batch Templates**: No workflow automation or preset management

## 🎯 Evolution Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Multi-Reference Support
**Priority: HIGH - Leverage existing backend, enhance frontend**

**Current State**: Backend fully implemented (upload-reference.ts), web app uses blob URLs
**Need**: Complete integration with sophisticated UX

**Requirements**:
- Replace blob URL workflow with cloud storage integration
- Reference pack management (save, name, reuse, share packs)
- Visual reference gallery with drag-and-drop reordering
- Batch reference upload with progress indicators
- Reference image cropping/adjustment tools
- Per-image reference mode selection (style_only vs style_and_composition)
- Reference pack templates and presets

### 2. Robust Batch Processing Architecture
**Priority: HIGH - Scale beyond current 10-row limit**

**Current State**: Synchronous processing, 10 rows max, 30 images per batch
**Need**: Async architecture with advanced capabilities

**Requirements**:
- Queue-based async processing for larger batches (50-100 rows)
- Real-time progress tracking with WebSocket updates
- Parallel image generation (multiple concurrent API calls)
- Partial failure recovery (continue processing if some items fail)
- Batch prioritization and scheduling
- Advanced error handling with exponential backoff retry
- Batch templates and workflow automation
- Save/resume interrupted batches

### 3. Advanced User Experience
**Priority: MEDIUM - Professional creative workflow**

**Requirements**:
- Batch comparison and A/B testing tools
- Generation history with search and filter
- Advanced prompt templating with reference integration
- Batch cost optimization suggestions
- Export capabilities (CSV, JSON, image archives)
- Collaborative features (shared batches, comments)

### 4. Scalability & Performance  
**Priority: MEDIUM - Future-proofing**

**Requirements**:
- Smart batching based on system load and cost limits
- Resource management and queue optimization
- Caching strategies for reference images and results
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Auto-scaling considerations for high-volume usage

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints & Guidelines

### Must Maintain
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Google Sheets integration must continue working
2. **Production Stability**: Zero downtime deployment, graceful degradation
3. **Cost Controls**: Enhanced but not removed - still essential for production use
4. **Authentication**: Existing API key system must be preserved
5. **Cloud Architecture**: Continue leveraging Google Cloud services (GCS, Cloud Run)

### Technical Standards
1. **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing throughout
2. **Zod Validation**: Continue using Zod schemas with `.strict()` mode
3. **RFC 7807**: Maintain Problem Details error handling standard
4. **Security**: No regression in security posture
5. **Observability**: Enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities

### Architecture Patterns
1. **Event-Driven**: Consider event-driven architecture for async processing
2. **Microservices Ready**: Design for potential service separation
3. **Stateless**: Maintain stateless processing where possible
4. **Resilient**: Enhanced fault tolerance and recovery patterns

## 💡 Key Questions to Address

1. **Architecture**: Should we implement a job queue system (Redis/Cloud Tasks) or enhance the current synchronous approach?

2. **State Management**: How should we handle complex batch states across web app sessions?

3. **WebSocket Strategy**: What's the best approach for real-time progress updates?

4. **Reference Pack Storage**: Should reference packs be user-specific or globally shareable?

5. **Scalability**: What are the optimal batch size limits considering API quotas and user experience?

6. **Error Recovery**: How sophisticated should partial failure recovery be?
