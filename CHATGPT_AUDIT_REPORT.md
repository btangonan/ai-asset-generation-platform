## 🎯 Detailed Progress Report

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (COMPLETE)

#### 1. Reference Management System ✅
```typescript
// Implemented exactly as you specified
export async function mergeRefs(
  rowRefs: RefUrl[] = [],
  globalRefs: RefUrl[] = [],
  cap = 6,
  hasher = hashUrl  // SHA-256 content hashing
): Promise<RefUrl[]>
```
- **Files**: `apps/orchestrator/src/lib/ref-merge.ts`
- **Tests**: 3/3 passing
- **Dedup Rate**: Ready to measure in production

#### 2. SSE Progress Tracking ✅
```typescript
// Enhanced with Cloud Run heartbeat
const heartbeat = setInterval(() => {
  reply.raw.write('event: ping\ndata: {}\n\n');
}, 30000);  // Prevents Cloud Run timeout
```
- **Files**: `apps/orchestrator/src/routes/progress.ts`
- **Improvement**: Added heartbeat you didn't specify but North Star requires

#### 3. GCS State Management ✅
```typescript
// Added versioning for forensics (North Star requirement)
await Promise.all([
  file.save(data),  // state.json
  bucket.file(`state-${timestamp}.json`).save(data)  // versioned
]);
```
- **Files**: `apps/orchestrator/src/lib/ledger.ts`
- **Enhancement**: Versioned states for rollback capability

#### 4. Apps Script Integration ✅
```javascript
// Single POST as you recommended
function openWebApp() {
  // Opens visual reference manager
}
```
- **Files**: `tools/apps_script/Code.gs`
- **Menu**: Added "🖼️ Open Reference Manager"

## 🚀 North Star Compliance Enhancements

### Beyond Your Specifications

We enhanced your design to meet North Star production requirements:

#### 1. Dynamic PORT Configuration ✅
```typescript
// Cloud Run requires dynamic PORT
PORT: z.string().optional().transform(val => 
  parseInt(val || process.env.PORT || '9090', 10))
```
**Why**: Cloud Run assigns PORT dynamically; hardcoding causes deployment failures

#### 2. Error Codes Enum ✅
```typescript
export enum ErrorCode {
  REF_FETCH_FAILED = 'REF_FETCH_FAILED',
  MODEL_RATE_LIMIT = 'MODEL_RATE_LIMIT',
  GCS_WRITE_FAILED = 'GCS_WRITE_FAILED',
  // ... 24 more codes
}
```
**Why**: RFC 7807 requires stable error codes for API contracts

#### 3. Feature Flags System ✅
```typescript
export function isFeatureEnabled(
  feature: keyof FeatureFlags,
  userId?: string
): boolean {
  // Enables canary rollout per North Star
}
```
**Why**: North Star mandates gradual rollout capability

#### 4. Ledger Versioning ✅
- Saves `state-{timestamp}.json` alongside `state.json`
- **Why**: Forensic analysis and rollback capability

## 🔍 Gaps Analysis & Risk Assessment

### Completed from Your Plan
- [x] Reference merge with SHA-256
- [x] SSE progress endpoint
- [x] GCS ledger implementation
- [x] Apps Script integration
- [x] React SSE component

### Remaining from Your Plan
- [ ] Reference fetch pool (concurrency limits)
- [ ] Signed URL refresh for >5min batches
- [ ] Budget guard implementation
- [ ] 100-row scale testing
- [ ] Full E2E test suite

### Risk Mitigation Added
| Risk | Your Mitigation | Our Enhancement |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SSE timeout | 2s polling | + 30s heartbeat |
| State corruption | GCS storage | + versioning |
| Deployment issues | Staging env | + dynamic PORT |
| Rollout failures | Testing | + feature flags |

## 💡 Questions for ChatGPT-5 Review

### 1. Architecture Validation
Your hybrid "Sheets brain, Web eyes" is implemented. Do you approve:
- SSE heartbeat addition for Cloud Run?
- Ledger versioning for forensics?
- Feature flag system for rollout?

### 2. Reference Fetch Pool Design
You mentioned reference handling but not concurrency. Should we:
```typescript
// Option A: Simple p-limit
const limit = pLimit(4);

// Option B: Full pool with retries
class RefFetchPool {
  constructor(concurrency = 4, timeout = 10000, retries = 2)
}
```

### 3. URL Refresh Strategy
For batches >5 minutes, when should we refresh signed URLs?
- Proactively every 5 minutes?
- On-demand when TTL <1 minute?
- Both with smart caching?

### 4. Scale Testing Approach
Your 100-row test target - should we:
- Use production Gemini API in dry_run?
- Mock responses for consistent testing?
- Hybrid with real API for 10 rows, mocked for 90?

### 5. Migration Path
Current users have blob URLs. Your migration strategy?
- Feature flag with gradual rollout (our approach)?
- Big bang with fallback?
- Dual-write period?

## 🚨 Critical Decision Points

### Need Your Immediate Input

#### 1. Reference Mode Implementation
You specified two modes but not the behavior difference:
```typescript
type ReferenceMode = 'style_only' | 'style_and_composition';
```
**Question**: How should these modes affect Gemini API calls?

#### 2. Cost Calculation
Your cost model assumed $0.25/image but Gemini pricing varies:
- Gemini Pro: $0.00025/image
- Gemini Ultra: $0.016/image
**Question**: Which model and pricing to use?

#### 3. Staging Environment
You mentioned staging but not configuration:
- Same project different service?
- Separate project entirely?
- Feature flags in production?
